# avro-schema-converter

Just some code to see how I can convert json into an avro schema. This is just used to generate an avro schema that should be seen as a base to improve the schema. Data types are inferred, therefore might not be correct and always should be validated. Next step to improve this, is to create an avro schema based on pyspark structtype.
